Algebra 1
Geometry and Trigonometry
Trigonometry is useful in Geometry, Algebra 2, and higher classes. I would not actually worry about Trigonometry until you run into it in Geometry.
Algebra 2
Precalculus and AP Statistics
If you are planning to Precalculus you will know the above.
statistics is typically taken after Algebra 2. You donâ€™t need to know Precalculus to take AP Statistics. Statistics generally, deals with reading graphs and probabilities.
AP Calculus AB
AP Calculus BC
10. Multivariable Calculus
11. Differential equations
12. Linear algebra
