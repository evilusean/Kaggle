# Electrical Engineering
## Preamble
I figure I'll start both math, pre-calculus for review, and Electrical Engineering at the same time, if I get in to January semester, I don't have as much time as I did with coding - scratch that - roastie gatekeepers on a highschool power trip think my grades from 15 years ago are somehow relevant, I run circles around your average normie, but I don't have a piece of paper, actual discriminASean, too smart for university, Lol, Lmao.

- Charge = 2 kinds of charges `+` positive and `-`negative. 
- Electrostatics = Opposites attract. Same Repel. Negative Repels Negative, Pos Repels Pos.
- one place we get 'charges' is from copper wire `Cu 29` = 29 protons and electrons(neutral, same amount), that last orbital on copper has just one electron, which is the easiest to pull away and have it participate in conduction 
- current = `q/sec` (charge per second)
- Shockingly(heh), water does not conduct, $H^2O$ has no free electrons, you need to add some NaCl(salt) to allow it to conduct - this goes against conventional wisdom "don't be in the water when there is lightning" - `Na`(sodiums) wil go towards the `+` positive charge and the `Cl`(chlorine) will go towards the `-` charge

- +Current = $q^-$ = Movement of charge the electrons move towards the  $q^-$ 
- $q/sec$ = amount of current flowing at any given time
- _1747_ - `Ben Franklin` said that the charges of an electron move _1747_ - he assigned the `+` and `-` to the electron charge, before people knew there was an electron charge 
- _1897_ - `JJ Thompson` discovered the electron charge $e^-$ 150 years after Ben Franklin
