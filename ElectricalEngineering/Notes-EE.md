# Electrical Engineering
## Preamble
I figure I'll start both math, pre-calculus for review, and Electrical Engineering at the same time, if I get in to January semester, I don't have as much time as I did with coding - scratch that - roastie gatekeepers on a highschool power trip think my grades from 15 years ago are somehow relevant, I run circles around your average normie, but I don't have a piece of paper, actual discriminASean, too smart for university, Lol, Lmao.

- Charge = 2 kinds of charges `+` positive and `-`negative. 
- Electrostatics = Opposites attract. Same Repel. Negative Repels Negative, Pos Repels Pos.
- one place we get 'charges' is from copper wire `Cu 29` = 29 protons and electrons(neutral, same amount), that last orbital on copper has just one electron, which is the easiest to pull away and have it participate in conduction 
- current = `q/sec` (charge per second)
- Shockingly(heh), water does not conduct, $H^2O$ has no free electrons, you need to add some NaCl(salt) to allow it to conduct - this goes against conventional wisdom "don't be in the water when there is lightning" - `Na`(sodiums) wil go towards the `+` positive charge and the `Cl`(chlorine) will go towards the `-` charge
