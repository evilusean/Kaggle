#### Preamble:
I had no notes on any of my courses, up until now, past sean appears to have just been copying and pasting syllabus'(i?) till now, started 2 years ago, because I thought 'you need math to code' - Nope. 
Since I want to take Electrical Engineering, I need to get my math up, So I can level up IRL, and escape frozen decadent rent seeking parasite infested overpriced economic zone failed state canada
Changed notes to '.md' so I can edit in obsidian, better UI than github, looks prettier.

##### Evaluating Functions-2024-11-07 :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvGsIo1TmsM&t=2s&ab_channel=KhanAcademy
- Function = Takes an input and returns an output. - will be deterministic - you can not associate 2 different outputs to one input, or it won't be a function
- $f(x)$ \#most used way to describe a function
- $y = x + 1$ \#This can also be a function
###### Worked example: Evaluating functions from equation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id6UovYjd-M&t=58s&ab_channel=KhanAcademy
$f(x) = 49 - {x}^{2}$ =24
###### Worked example: Evaluating functions from graph
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzYtx_AqzjM&ab_channel=KhanAcademy
find on a graph : $f(-1)$ =6
##### Evaluating Discrete Functions-2024-11-07:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddw8u7nNmKs&ab_channel=KhanAcademy
$y=h(x)$ 
- When `x = 4` what is `y = ?` y = 3
- given the input, what is the output, it's easy on graphs, cause you just look up the x-axis, and find y
###### Worked example: evaluating expressions with function notation :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaPm3Tpuxbc
$-2 * f(-6) + g(1)$
#### 2:Inputs and outputs of a function-2024-11-07
###### Worked example: matching an input to a function's output (graph):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rmmynff5Yc
find $g(x) = -2$ = -9
###### Worked example: two inputs with the same output (graph):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSktOkaW6EA&ab_channel=KhanAcademy
What is the value other than -5 for which $f(x) = f(-5)$ x = 4
#### 3:Composing functions-2024-11-07
###### Intro to composing functions:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUNWjd4bMmw&ab_channel=KhanAcademy
$f(x) = {x}^{2}-1$
- composing function = to build up a function by composing one function of others function, *nested functions* = $f(g(2))$ = Take the number 2, put it through the function `g` take that output an d put it through `f`
- in the video he has a chart where he is getting his $g(t)$ and a graph for $h(2)$ - so can't work out the formula
