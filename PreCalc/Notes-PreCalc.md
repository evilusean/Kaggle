Start: 07November2024

### Preamble:
I had no notes on any of my courses, up until now, past sean appears to have just been copying and pasting syllabus'(i?) till now, started 2 years ago, because I thought 'you need math to code' - Nope. 
Since I want to take Electrical Engineering, I need to get my math up, So I can level up IRL, and escape frozen decadent rent seeking parasite infested overpriced economic zone failed state canada
Changed notes to '.md' so I can edit in obsidian, better UI than github, looks prettier.

- Function = Takes an input and returns an output. - will be deterministic - you can not associate 2 different outputs to one input, or it won't be a function
- $f(x)$ \#most used way to describe a function
- $y = x + 1$ \#This can also be a function
###### Worked example: Evaluating functions from equation

$f(x) = 49 - {x}^{2}$ =24
###### Worked example: Evaluating functions from graph

find on a graph : $f(-1)$ =6
